## Vue-UI
This is a 'port' of the [Semantic-UI](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/tree/1.0) modules as Vue.js components.
I created this set of modules for a few reasons:
* I did not want to use jQuery with Semantic-UI
* Too much JS code for each module
* Make it easy to consume these modules in Vue.js
* Set some defaults w/ options to override them

### ui-accordion
### ui-checkbox
### ui-dimmer
```html
<ui-dimmer></ui-dimmer>
```

### ui-modal

### ui-progress

### ui-rating
